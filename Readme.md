# GRSS

This is a simple Grep clone. This repository should serve as a base for CLI utilities written in Rust.

The initial project is inspired by the [Rust-CLI tutorial](https://rust-cli.github.io/book/index.html).

There is also a [Cookbook](https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-cookbook/intro.html) on how to do things with Rust.
